$sudo dnf install git-all

If you are on a Debian based distro I recommend trying apt:
$sudo apt install git-all


/////////////////////////
You will use the following to install from source. Note that the following libraries Git depends on:
autotools
curl
zlib
openssl
expat
libiconv

For example, if you’re on a system that has dnf or apt-get
you can use one of these commands to install the minimal dependencies for compiling and installing the Git binaries:

$ sudo dnf install dh-autoreconf curl-devel expat-devel gettext-devel \
  openssl-devel perl-devel zlib-devel
$ sudo apt-get install dh-autoreconf libcurl4-gnutls-dev libexpat1-dev \
  gettext libz-dev libssl-dev
  
In order to be able to add the documentation in various formats these additional dependencies are required.

$ sudo dnf install asciidoc xmlto docbook2X
$ sudo apt-get install asciidoc xmlto docbook2x

If you’re using a Debian-based distribution you also need the install-info package:
$ sudo apt-get install install-info

If you’re using a RPM-based distro you also need the getopt package this is already installed on a Debian-based distro
$ sudo dnf install getopt
$ sudo apt-get install getopt

Additionally if you’re using you a Fedora need to do this
$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/db2x_docbook2texi /usr/bin/docbook2x-texi

When you have all the necessary dependencies you can grab the latest tagged release tarball from several places.
You can get this via the kernel.org site at https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git
or the mirror on the GitHub website, at https://github.com/git/git/releases.
It’s generally a little clearer what the latest version is on the GitHub page.

$ tar -zxf git-2.0.0.tar.gz
$ cd git-2.0.0
$ make configure
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ make all doc info
$ sudo make install install-doc install-html install-info

When this is complete you can also get Git via Git for updates

$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git

You will still require setup
