When the installation is complete you can use the heroku command from your terminal.

On Windows you will use the heroku login command.

$ heroku login
heroku: Press any key to open up the browser to login or q to exit
 ›   Warning: If browser does not open, visit
 ›   https://cli-auth.heroku.com/auth/browser/***
heroku: Waiting for login...
Logging in... done
Logged in as mufasa@helloworld.com

This will open your web browser to the Heroku login page
If your browser is already logged in to Heroku click the Log in button displayed on the page
This will authenticate and is required for both the heroku and git commands to work correctly

This will work for any version of Node grater than 8
$node --version
v11.12.13

npm is installed with Node, if it is not installed I recommend a more recent version of Node:
$ npm --version
v12.13.14

Now we will verify that git is installed
$ git --version
git version 12.13.14
