At this point you will be ready to deploy to Heroku

In order to create an app on Heroku you will conduct the following:

$ heroku create
Creating chocolate-rain-206... done, stack is heroku-18
http://chocolate-rain-206.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/chocolate-rain-206.git
Git remote heroku added

When you create an app a heroku (git remote) will also be created and associated with your local git repository

Heroku generates a random name, but in my case I called it chocolate-rain-206 because I have a sense of humor

But you can pass a parameter that pecifies your own app name, but that may be boring

Anyway, now  we deploy your code:

$ git push heroku master

 * [new branch]      master -> master
 
The app has been deployed. I recommend verifying at least one instance of your baby is running:
$ heroku ps:scale web=1

Now we will navigate to the URL generated by the app name.
But I am a lazy person and love shortcuts.

$ heroku open
