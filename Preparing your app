Here you'll prepare an application that is ready to deploy to Heroku

I highly recommend using the Heroku-provided sample application
If you are brave, take a look at this:

https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/preparing-a-codebase-for-heroku-deployment

To clone a local version of the sample application that is deployable execute the following command in term

git clone https://github.com/heroku/node-js-getting-started.git
cd node-js-getting-started

Viola, you have a functioning Git repository that contains an application as well as a beautiful package.json
